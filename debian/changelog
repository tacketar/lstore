lstore (2.0.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Ability to bundle the latest libfuse3
  * User accounts added and path based ACLs
  * LFS Extended ACL support by mapping LStore credentials to local accounts
  * User R/W file locking across all processes attached to an LServer instance
  * Internal R/W file locking for tracking and synchronization between processes
  * Special file support -- FIFO and socket files. These don't cooredinate between LFS mounts and are just local
  * Ability to set file execute bit
  * Support for Rocky Linux 9
  * TCMUrunner support updated for using an LStore file as an iSCSI target
  * Extensive client and srver side logging to aid in troubleshooting with daily log rotation
  * More detailed state information related to open files and file system ops.
  * Low-level operations to track complex issues that can be enabled/disabled on the fly.
  * Updated log, mirror and cache segment drivers
  * Initial tooling for recovery log in case hard errors are encountered during writes - incomplete
  * LFS readdir processing moved to external thread for performance
  * Ability to have a local per file buffer to help get around small I/O for certain use cases.
  * Server side atomic create object routines
  * Properly characterizing long-running vs short tasks on the server to minimize threadpool blocking
  * Ability to dynamically rename an object -- file or directory -- and have it's open FD's and locks properly be tracked
  * Sharding of metadata directories in the LServer for increased IOPs performance
  * Added additional warming mode for large filesets. The new mode is a 2-phase process -- walking the FS and "baking".
      -  Walking can be a full normal walking of the FS or you can take an incrementatl from the last walk/inc
  * Server side tracking of open files and locks
  * Support for symlinks outside LFS
  * File system abstraction layer that mimics traditional POSIX calls, open, close, read, write, etc
  * Stdio wrapper for LD_PRELOAD applications
  * Tons of bug fixes and performance improvements
  * Small files can now be stored as metadata
